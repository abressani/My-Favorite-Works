Final project for my computational physics class. I chose bifurcation 
and recursion due to an interesting video I saw on YouTube. I remember 
getting absolutely obsessed with it for a couple weeks and completing 
this early. I was so happy with how it turned out. 

Recommended: Set_2000x2000, code/mandlebrot_set
